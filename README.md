# Final Fantasy MiniWiki

### View quick facts about your favorite Final Fantasy characters.

This is a single page app that lets Final Fantasy fans view quick facts about their favorite Final Fantasy characters. Just by clicking on each picture, the user can select the character they're interested in and the app will load that characters info. Although the app doesn't trigger a page refresh, it provides the user URLs for each character so that they can quickly revisit the view containing a specific character's info.

User can:

* View new character information at the click of a picture
* Save a URL to visit the site with a specific character's info loaded

Tech Highlights:

* Used **AJAX** to fetch new character info
* Used vanilla JS to re-render views based on selected character
* Created a **vanilla JS history API router** from scratch
* Images are progressively loaded from blurred placeholders to full images
